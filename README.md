# Data Analysis and Mini Recommender System
This is a submission repo for 'What The Hack' Hackathon organized by Technical Council 2024

## Overview
This submission involves exploring a dataset, framing questions, and performing data analysis. The tasks include dataset exploration, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of a mini recommender system.

## Project Structure
1. **Dataset Exploration:** Loaded the dataset using Pandas and NumPy to understand its structure.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized data distributions and identified missing values/outliers.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, normalized data, and encoded categorical variables.
4. **Framing Questions & Insights:** Developed questions and derived insights from the data.
5. **Mini Recommender System:** Implemented a basic recommender system instead of a classifier.

## Key Insights
- **EDA:** Provided insights into data distributions and relationships between variables.
- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured data was ready for analysis by addressing missing values and standardizing formats.
- **Recommender System:** Developed to suggest items based on user preferences, showcasing practical use of the data.


## Usage
To reproduce the analysis, run the provided Python scripts in sequence. Ensure necessary libraries (`Pandas`, `NumPy`, etc.) are installed.
